* Bower (http://bower.io/) - A package manager for the web that we use to pull in specific versions of javascript libraries that the extension uses. 
- uses .bowerrc to specify where bower components get installed.

* Karma - a test runner or angular js. 

* Grunt - a JavaScript task runner. We plan to use this to run the Karma tests. 

* package.json - node package manager (npm) mostly we use this to specify stuff we use for Grunt.
