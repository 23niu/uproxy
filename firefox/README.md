Download the [Firefox add-on SDK](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-Us/developers/builder). Extract the SDK and cd into the extracted directory. Enter `source bin/activate` into the terminal.

Navigate to UProxy/firefox and run the command `cfx run`. This will run the add-on in a temporary firefox profile.
