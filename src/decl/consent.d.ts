// This interface is implemented by consent.ts

// Consent is REQUESTED by the receiver and OFFERD by the giver; when consent is requested and
// offered, then it is GRANTED. Before either have happened, the state is NONE. IGNORE_XXX
// actions can happen by the side that has not taken any action. This puts the state into the
// IGNORED state.
