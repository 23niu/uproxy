    <h2 id="learnMore">What is uProxy?</h2>
    <p>uProxy is an open source browser extension for Chrome and Firefox that lets users share their route to the Internet with each other. uProxy can make it much harder for a third party to monitor or interfere with the traffic of the user who is getting access. It's like a personalised VPN service that you can use to provide secure access to friends and family, and to yourself, when you travel.</p>

    <h2 id="getShare">What does "get access" and "share access" mean?</h2>
    <p>When you are <b>getting access</b> from a friend, all the web traffic from your browser first travels encrypted to your friend's computer and from there, to the Internet. This means that, to most websites, the request will appear to be coming from your friend's computer, and someone monitoring your connection will only see that you have a secure connection to your friend.</p>
    <p>When you are <b>sharing access</b>, friends you authorize will be able to send their web traffic to your machine and from there to the Internet. Each device a user owns must be explicitly authorized by the sharer, before it is able to connect, and authorization can be revoked at any time.</p>

    <h2 id="sharerAccess">When I am sharing access, what does the other party have access to?</h2>
    <p>Users who are getting access from your machine are only able to access the Internet. They cannot look at files on your computer, see what you're doing on the Internet, or log into websites using your identity. They also cannot access devices on your local home or work network.</p>

    <h2 id="social">Why does uProxy connect to social networks?</h2>
    <p>uProxy needs a way to see when your friends are online, and it needs to exchange information, to know how to connect with them. Instead of running a central service that could be easily blocked, uProxy uses social networks that you and your friends are already using. <b>uProxy will never post publicly on your behalf.</b> It only exchanges private messages with friends of yours who are also running uProxy.</p>

    <h2 id="protect">How does uProxy help protect my Internet connection?</h2>
    <p>The connection between a user and their friend is encrypted and secure from interference. For example, if Bob is getting access from Alice, and they're in different countries, then Bob's ISP (or anyone else who can monitor his connection) will not be able to see what Bob is doing on the Internet or interfere with his ability to connect to websites securely. But, if Alice's computer is in an insecure location, Bob will not necessarily be making his Internet connection any more private or secure by connecting through her.</p>

    <h2 id="trust">Why is it important that I trust the people I am connecting with?</h2>
    <p>uProxy is designed to be used to connect friends, and there are risks to both both access getters and sharers, if they connect to people they don't trust. If you get access from a friend who is malicious, they may be able to spy on your web browsing or execute a man-in-the-middle attack on your connections to secure sites. If you share access with someone you don't know, they may be able to use your connection to engage in illegal activity, and depending on the laws in your country, you may be responsible for facilitating that activity. Also, if you are using uProxy to get access to the Internet from a friend, you have to trust that your friend's Internet connection is secure.</p>

    <h2 id="anonymity">Does uProxy give me anonymity online?</h2>
    <p>uProxy is not an anonymity service; it is useful for concealing your browsing from your ISP, but not for hiding your identity from the sites you visit. A website visited by someone who is getting access via uProxy will be able to see the IP address of the person who is sharing access, and the website may be able to discover the IP address of the uProxy user who is getting access.</p>

    <h2 id="proxiedData">What isn't proxied, and can uProxy leak information about the sites you visit?</h2>
    <p>uProxy only proxies traffic for the web browser it is running in and not for other applications, like email programs. In addition, some browser extensions may not use uProxy for all their traffic. Flash is the most common example of this, and users who are concerned about Flash leaking the identity of the sites they visit should disable Flash in their browser (instructions for Chrome and Firefox). WebRTC is also not proxied, though use of WebRTC in web pages is relatively rare (it's used mostly for peer-to-peer applications, like chat). In addition, some DNS requests may not be proxied, which could leak information about the sites a user is trying to visit.</p>

    <h2 id="logging">Does uProxy log data about me?</h2>
    <p>No logs are sent to or collected on a server, unless a user chooses to submit logs from their current session as part of a bug report (feedback). Logs may contain personally identifiable information (PII). PII is never shared outside the uProxy team, and PII (and the logs that contain it) are it is only retained for at most three months, before being deleted.</p>

    <h2 id="who">Who made uProxy?</h2>
    <p>uProxy is being developed by the University of Washington. The project was seeded by Google Ideas and has received contributions from Google, Brave New Software, and the open source community.</p>

    <h2 id="trustedTesters">Why is uProxy launched for trusted testers only to start with? </h2>
    <p>The researchers at the University of Washington are working to make uProxy as secure and private as it can be. uProxy's trusted tester programme is intended to get user feedback and fix bugs before releasing it more widely.</p>
