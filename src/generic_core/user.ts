/**
 * user.ts
 *
 * This file defines the uProxy User class. :User is a type relevant both in the
 * Core and the UI, which is why it is in the top-level directory.
 *
 * Here is further information on the interactions between Clients and
 * Instances.
 *
 * Clients hold state for 'a user logged onto a network from a specific device'.
 * They are also ephemeral, so once the client logs out, it is gone forever
 * (the next time the user logs on from the same device to the same network,
 * there will be a new client ID).
 *
 * An Instance is specific to a client running uProxy. More precisely, an
 * Instance represents 'a uProxy installation on a device for a user', and are
 * semi-permanent. Since clients are ephemeral, an Instance can/will be
 * associated with multiple clients over its lifetime, as its uProxy clients
 * login and logout. There will however, only ever be one client at a time.
 * The tricky bit is that the Instance is associated not with the 'human' chat
 * client, but with the 'uProxy' non-human client.
